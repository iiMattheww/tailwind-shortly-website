# tailwind-shortly-website

A small practice project for learning and collecting Tailwind CSS snippets and patterns to reuse across other projects.

**Status:** Learning / Reference

**Purpose:** Keep a lightweight, practical reference of Tailwind layouts, components, and utility patterns that I can copy into other projects.

**Files of interest**
- `index.html` — demo / example pages
- `src/style.css` — Tailwind/custom CSS
- `src/script/main.js` — minimal JS for interactions
- `public/` — static assets served by Vite

**Preview**
Open the site locally to preview and iterate on snippets.

**Prerequisites**
- Node.js (14+ recommended)
- npm (or yarn)

**Quick start**
1. Install dependencies

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run development server (Vite)

```powershell
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

3. Build for production

```powershell
npm run build
npm run preview
```

**How to use this repo**
- Browse `index.html` and `src/` to find small, focused examples (buttons, cards, layouts).
- Copy the HTML and Tailwind class patterns into other projects as needed.
- Keep snippets small and framework-agnostic where possible.

**Development notes**
- This project uses Vite for local development and building.
- Tailwind configuration (if present) is in the project root — adjust `tailwind.config.js` if you add it.

**Contributing**
- This repo is primarily for your personal reference. If you want to add snippets, keep them concise and document intent.

**Git**
Add and commit the README before pushing to your remote:

```powershell
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add concise README"
git push
```

**License**
See the `LICENSE` file in the repository.
